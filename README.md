# UI-Element-Project
Greetings. Here is my project for API/UI design! This project was to test my 
Javascript DOM skills, Javascript skills, HTML, and CSS Skills all in one.
For JS DOM I had to obtain an API from online and obtain data from the API and 
then create an UI and combine the two! I chose to use the "genius" API and took
song titles from my rapper's songs that turned me into a fan of them. And then
I created an accordion UI to display the information. This project was fun!
